Danny's Diner is a newly opened restaurant that serves sushi, curry, and ramen. The owner, Danny, wants to use the data collected from the restaurant to get insights into his customers' behavior, including their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent, and which menu items are their favorites. Danny is seeking assistance to generate some basic datasets that his team can use to inspect the data without needing to use SQL. He also wants to know if he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.

Danny has provided three key datasets for the case study: sales, menu, and members.

The following entity diagram represent the relationship between the database tables:

Each of the following case study questions was answer in this projecy a single SQL statement (see DannysMa_Dinnerchallenge.sql) :

- What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
- How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
- What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
- What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
- Which item was the most popular for each customer?
- Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
- Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
- What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
- If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
- In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date), they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

Additionally, there are two bonus questions:

- Recreate a specific Menu output using the available data
- Rank all customer products.
